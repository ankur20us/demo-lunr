# demo-lunr
A demo to show the functionality of Lunr database / indexing db

The main purpose of the lunr api is to return the references of the matched documents and not the document itself, its like, you create the index and after that when you search on top of it, it(lunr) will return the references of the documents that contain the original data, so getting that original data is basically your headache :D.

1. npm install
2. npm start
